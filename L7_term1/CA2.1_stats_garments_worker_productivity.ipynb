The data does NOT provide strong evidence to support company's claim that implementation of new machines was successful in reducing overtime. In the real manufacturing world, there are many factors to consider, we don't have enough evidence in this data file to reject H0 doesn't mean it's true. Implementation of new machines usually involves testing, production line halt due to errors or adjustment, worker operation fault etc, these data are not captured in this data file."
